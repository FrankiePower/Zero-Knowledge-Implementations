# Polynomial Representation in Rust

This repository contains a Rust implementation of polynomial representation using two different approaches: **Dense Representation** and **Sparse Representation**.

## Summary

Polynomials can be represented in multiple ways, each with trade-offs in terms of memory efficiency and access speed. This project demonstrates:

- **Dense Representation**: Uses an array where each index represents a power of `x`, and the value at that index is the coefficient. This method ensures direct access to coefficients but may be inefficient for sparse polynomials.
- **Sparse Representation**: Stores only non-zero coefficients along with their corresponding exponents as tuples. This method is memory-efficient but requires additional lookups for coefficient retrieval.

## Features

- Efficient polynomial storage and retrieval.
- Demonstrates both dense and sparse polynomial representations.
- Provides a comparison of performance trade-offs.

## Installation & Usage

To compile and run the program, use:

```sh
cargo run
```

## Comparison Table

| Representation | Pros                    | Cons                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Dense          | Fast coefficient access | Inefficient for sparse polynomials  |
| Sparse         | Memory-efficient        | Lookup operations require searching |
